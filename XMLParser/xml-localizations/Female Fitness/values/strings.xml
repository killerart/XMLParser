    <string name="ex_name_7">Lying Side Crunch</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_7">Lie on your right side with the left hand on the side of the head and legs slightly raised, left over right. Proceed to lift your torso upward and back down, using your right elbow to maintain stability. Pause, then return to starting position.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_8">V-Up</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_8">Lay flat on your back and extend your arms over your head. You do not need to clasp your hands together for this exercise. In a slow, controlled motion, simultaneously lift your arms and legs, so that they meet at the midpoint of your torso.  Extend back to the starting position in a slow, controlled motion. Keep your gaze towards the ceiling.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_9">Bench Jump</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_9">Begin with a box or bench 1-2 feet in front of you. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.

    <string name="ex_name_10">Seated Cable Rows</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_10">For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise: - Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. - Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. - Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Caution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_11">Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_11">Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position: - As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. - The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. - The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. - Inhale during this portion of the movement. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_12">Hyperextensions (Back Extensions)</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_12">Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad, leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you or behind your head. This will be your starting position: Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. - Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. - Inhale as you perform this movement. - Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back. - Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_13">Assisted Pull-Up</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_13">Step up and grasp bar with wide overhand grip. Step down onto assistance lever or platform. Some assisted machines require you to kneel on platform. If no assisted machine is used, assist as needed by allowing training partner to pull feet up behind legs or push self up with legs on elevation. Range of motion will decrease if grip is too wide.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_14">Bent Over Two-Dumbbell Row</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_14">With a dumbbell in each hand (palms facing your torso), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward by bending at the waist; as you bend make sure to keep your back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor. Tip: Make sure that you keep the head up. The weights should hang directly in front of you as your arms hang perpendicular to the floor and your torso. This is your starting position: - While keeping the torso stationary, lift the dumbbells to your side (as you breathe out), keeping the elbows close to the body (do not exert any force with the forearm other than holding the weights). - On the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a second. - Slowly lower the weight again to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Caution:This exercise is not recommended for people with back problems. A Low Pulley Row is a better choice for people with back issues. Ensure perfect form and never round the back as this can promote back injury. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_15">Stiff Leg Barbell </string>
    <string name="ex_desc_15">This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position: - Keeping your legs stationary, move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. - Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor. - Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Caution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The stiff-legged barbell good morning is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_16">Reverse Flyes</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_16">To begin, lie down on an incline bench with the chest and stomach pressing against the incline. Have the dumbbells in each hand with the palms facing each other (neutral grip). Extend the arms in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench. The legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the ball of your toes. This is the starting position: - Maintaining the slight bend of the elbows, move the weights out and away from each other (to the side) in an arc motion while exhaling. Tip: Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise. - The arms should be elevated until they are parallel to the floor. - Feel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_17">One-Arm Dumbbell Row</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_17">Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position: - Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. - Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.\cf0  \cf2 Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm. Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.</string>
    <string name="ex_name_18">Dumbbell Biceps Curl</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_18">Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand at arm\'s length. Keep your elbows close to your torso and rotate the palms of your hands until they are facing forward.

    <string name="ex_name_40">Leg Extensions</string>
    <string name="ex_desc_40">For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position: Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle. - Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. - Pause a second on the contracted position. - Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.
