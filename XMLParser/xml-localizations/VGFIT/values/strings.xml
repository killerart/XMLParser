THIS WAY IT IS OUT OF THE WAY, AND IT WILL REALLY BOOST YOUR ENERGY FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE DAY TO FOLLOW. IT IS A LITTLE TOUGH IN THE BEGINNING, BUT AFTER A WEEK, YOU WILL FEEL SO GOOD DOING IT, YOU WILL BE LOCKED IN A ROUTINE. \n\n  IF THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN DO IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, I WOULD DO IT RIGHT AFTER YOU TRAIN WITH WEIGHTS OR AT NIGHT AFTER YOUR LAST MEAL. BRING A HEADSET WITH YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC TO HELP THE TIME GO FASTER.</string>
